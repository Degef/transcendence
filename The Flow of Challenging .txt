The Flow of Challenging 

1. user1 clicks challenge button of the individual and creates a web socket connection to new consumer with the name of the challenged user and waites for the other guys acceptance.
2. this will change the is_challenged var of user2 to true
3. there will be a loop in the javascript that checks if a user is challenged, now if this loop is true it will ask user2 that user1 is challenging him to the game

4. if challenge is accepted this will create a websocket connection and if the name matches the one that's been waited the game starts


1. user1 clicks challenge button of the individual. This action will change the is_challenged var of user2 to true and put user1 in a waiting and checking reply mode. which means he will be constantly checking if user2 accepted or rejected the challenge. 

2. there will be a loop in the javascript that checks if a user is challenged,

3. if challenge is accepted, this will update the challenge_respons var to "accepted", and he will connecte to the web socket. at the same time the challenger will findout that the challenge is accepted and connect to the web socket with the other guy.

4. On the other hand if challenge is rejected the challenge_respons var will be "rejected". when the challenger findout that is it rejected this will display that the challenge is rejected and there won't be any connection.
