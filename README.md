# ft_transcendence Project

## Overview
**ft_transcendence** is the final project of the 42 Common Core program, developed by our team. It is a single-page web application featuring an online real-time Pong game, tournaments, chat functionality, user account management, and player statistics. The project combines gameplay, competition, and social interaction, utilizing Django for the backend and vanilla JavaScript with HTML, CSS, and the Bootstrap library for the frontend.

## Features
### 1. Real-Time Pong Game
Players can engage in a responsive, real-time Pong game. The game uses server-client communication for real-time interactivity.

### 2. Tournament Mode
A structured tournament mode where multiple users can compete, adding a competitive aspect to the game.

### 3. Chat Feature
A live chat system is integrated to allow players to communicate during games or in the lobby, enhancing the social aspect of the game.

### 4. User Account System
- **User Creation & Authentication**: Players can create accounts, log in, and manage their profiles. Authentication is handled securely through Djangoâ€™s built-in user management.
- **Profile Pages**: Each player has a dedicated profile page displaying personal information, statistics, and preferences.

### 5. Game Dashboard
Players have access to a personal dashboard that tracks game stats such as the number of games played, won, and lost, allowing users to keep track of their progress.

## Technologies Used
- **Backend**: Django (Python)
- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
